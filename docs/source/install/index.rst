If for some reason are you don't use windows, don't worry linux community is really big, so there is multiple tools to done a good installation and "virtualization", at the end most of the methods uses `wine <https://www.winehq.org/>`_, however if you are not a Nerd in Computers don't worry, exist other tools that makes this process easy.
