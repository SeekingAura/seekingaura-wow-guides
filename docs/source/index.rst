Wow Seeking Aura Guides
=======================

Notes, tips, and cheat sheets for wow, based on my personal experience!

Gaming is not just about "playing a game and nothing else" While enjoying and relaxing with a game, you can also solve puzzles and problems, dive into programming, scripting, data analysis, and so much more! Within every game, communities create a wealth of tools-like extended context, enhanced UI, data utilities, scripting resources, and beyond. Personally, I love exploring the possibilities of programming within games (such as creating macros and addons), as well as analyzing data like damage behavior, market trends, app usage, etc.

I spend my relaxing moments with gaming while thinking up new programming ideas and doing research. Here, I want to share relevant insights that could be useful to others interested in programming in games, along with general tips and tools that have been helpful to me.

* Do you enjoy learning how things work?
* Do you enjoy creating and exploring your own ideas?
* Do you enjoy doing research?

Here you will find notes that could enhance your gaming experience (specially if you enjoy learn stuff).

`World of Warcraft <https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/start>`_ (also known as :abbr:`WoW (World of Warcraft)`) is a :abbr:`MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game)` that was first launched in 2004. Nowadays, the game has changed significantly in terms of its structure and lore. I personally consider the social aspect an important factor in :abbr:`MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game)` but actually in wow is almost **dead**. This is because the developers have tried to adapt the game to different kind of players: consistent players, try-hards, casuals, Game esports enthusiasts, and others.

Currently, there are different versions of the game available. One is the **Retail version**, the current version of :abbr:`WoW (World of Warcraft)`, which caters more to casual players (try to have events, activities that does not an issue if you spend few time) and also supports esports competitions. Every minor update introduces a new season, during which events like the :abbr:`MDI (Mythic Dungeon International)` take place.

Another version is :abbr:`WoW (World of Warcraft)` Classic, which preserves the original structure of the game. It's designed for players who enjoy playing daily and spending more time in-game (usually this version requires more grinding than retail) typically the more dedicated crowd.

On this page, I will focus specifically on the **Retail version**, as I will focus the information for new and casual players. In the navigation bar, you can find different topics I've written about feel free to take a look! below will have glossary with some terms that could helpfully even for experimented players.
