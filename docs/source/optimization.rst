Recover disk space from old updates
-----------------------------------

Some data are used for recovery or temporary "fast" updates, but sometimes these files are not eligibles to be deleted "automatically" by battlenet, so based on this icy veins article [#free_wow_space_disk]_ do:

Delete 

.. sourcecode:: text

   C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\Data\config
   C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\Data\indices

These folder are updated to identify the updates and some patch do execute, the issue is that does not delete the old index updates
